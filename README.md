# huffman-coding
A program for coding and decoding Huffman strings. The program created to learn some of the more advanced concepts of Haskell and the functional paradigm in general. 

## What I learned
- Implementing recursive datatypes
- Using your own datatypes and typeclasses
- Understanding the Huffman coding algorithm and its basic concept.
